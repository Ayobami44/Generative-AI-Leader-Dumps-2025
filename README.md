I recently prepared for and passed the Google Generative AI Leader certification, and Iâ€™d like to share what helped me most.
After researching multiple sources, I found SkillCertExams to be incredibly useful. They offer real exam-style practice questions that helped me understand the core concepts and exam structure.

Their questions were regularly updated, scenario-based, and aligned closely with what I saw on the actual exam. If you're serious about passing on the first attempt, Iâ€™d highly recommend checking them out.
